# Bevy Platformer Game

A feature-rich 2D platformer game built with Bevy Engine in Rust, totally generated by AI with only prompt interaction. So I should say I've "Devrompt" this myself! :)

## 🎮 Latest Features (v2.1)

- **🔊 Real Audio System**: Jump, collect, and death sound effects with WAV files
- **🍎 Fruit Collection**: Collect orange fruits to advance levels
- **❤️ Lives System**: 3 lives with visual counter
- **📊 Level Progression**: Level counter increases when collecting fruit
- **🎲 Smart Random Generation**: Platforms generate with intelligent spacing rules
- **🎯 Platform-Based Fruit Placement**: Fruits always spawn on top of platforms
- **🚀 Enhanced Movement**: Air control and higher jumping capabilities
- **✅ Bug Fixes**: Player now properly spawns at game start, death sound plays correctly

## Prerequisites

You need to have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed:

1. **Install Rust**: Go to [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the installation instructions for Windows
   - Download and run `rustup-init.exe`
   - Follow the on-screen instructions
   - Restart your terminal/PowerShell after installation

2. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify Rust is working:
   ```powershell
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

## How to Run

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Git\RustBevy
   ```

2. **Build and run the game**:
   ```powershell
   cargo run
   ```

   The first build may take several minutes as it downloads and compiles dependencies.

## 🎮 Game Controls

- **Move Left**: ← Arrow Key or A
- **Move Right**: → Arrow Key or D  
- **Jump**: Space, ↑ Arrow Key, or W

## 🎯 Game Objective

- **Collect Fruits**: Find and collect the orange fruit on each level
- **Survive**: Avoid falling off the screen (you have 3 lives)
- **Progress**: Each fruit collected advances you to the next level with new random platforms

## ✨ Game Features

### Visual Elements
- **Player Character**: Blue square (50x50) with smooth movement
- **Dynamic Platforms**: Gray platforms with intelligent random generation
- **Collectible Fruits**: Orange fruits that spawn on platforms
- **UI Display**: Lives and level counters in bright colors
- **Game Title**: "BEVY PLATFORMER" displayed at the top

### Audio System 🔊
- **Jump Sound**: 440Hz beep (0.2 seconds) when jumping
- **Collect Sound**: 880Hz beep (0.3 seconds) when collecting fruit
- **Death Sound**: 220Hz beep (0.5 seconds) when losing a life
- **Real WAV Files**: Generated procedurally and played through Bevy's audio system

### Game Mechanics
- **Lives System**: Start with 3 lives, lose one when falling off screen
- **Level Progression**: Collect fruit to advance levels (infinite progression)
- **Smart Platform Generation**: Platforms placed with minimum distance rules
- **Physics**: Realistic gravity, collision detection, and air control
- **Boundary System**: Player stays within window bounds

## 🔧 Advanced Game Mechanics

### Movement & Physics
- **Gravity System**: Realistic downward acceleration
- **Ground Detection**: Player can only jump when touching a platform
- **Air Control**: Full movement control while jumping/falling
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents passing through platforms
- **Smooth Movement**: Responsive controls with configurable speed

### Platform Generation Algorithm
- **Smart Spacing**: Minimum distance requirements between platforms
- **Player-Friendly Gaps**: Ensures platforms are always reachable
- **Random Seeding**: Uses system time for true randomness each level
- **Boundary Safety**: Platforms stay within playable area

### Fruit Collection System
- **Platform-Based Placement**: Fruits only spawn on top of existing platforms
- **Starting Platform Exclusion**: Never spawns on the initial player platform
- **Collision Detection**: 30-unit radius for collection
- **Level Regeneration**: New platforms and fruit on each collection

## 🛠️ Technical Details

## ⚙️ Customization

You can easily modify the game by changing constants in `src/main.rs`:

### Movement & Physics
- `PLAYER_SPEED`: Horizontal movement speed (default: 300.0)
- `JUMP_SPEED`: Jump height/velocity (default: 700.0)
- `GRAVITY`: Downward acceleration (default: 2000.0)
- `AIR_CONTROL`: Air movement control factor (default: 1.0)

### Display & Layout
- `WINDOW_WIDTH` / `WINDOW_HEIGHT`: Game window dimensions (1200x800)

### Platform Generation
- `MIN_PLATFORM_DISTANCE`: Minimum space between platforms (80.0)
- `MIN_GAP_FOR_PLAYER`: Minimum gap for player movement (80.0)
- `MIN_VERTICAL_GAP`: Minimum vertical space for jumping (60.0)

### Audio Settings
